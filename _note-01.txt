//now here we will do update related task for user profile

1. create controller updateProfile
2. create route for updateProfile router.put("/profile", requireSignin, updateProfile);
3. code into updateProfile
  take input from postman/user site,
  find user by find method and get by id(we will get id from requireSignin middleware),
  update user by update method,
  save user by save method,
  send response to user but without password.
  so we made updated.password = undefined.
  finish updating user profile.

// now we will work on category
1. create category model --> Category
2. create category controller --> create
3. create category route --> router.post("/category", requireSignin, isAdmin, create);
4. get category name from user
5. when creating category slugify category name and store it.
   here we will do some validation like if same category exists then we will return
    error message to user.
